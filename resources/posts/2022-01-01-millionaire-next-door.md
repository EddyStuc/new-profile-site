**Another highly recommended book**

I've been reading many finance books over the past couple of years trying to learn more about investing and the stock market.

This book "The Millionaire Next Door" doesn't teach you about stocks or investing but rather about how so many people in the world
these days are always trying to show off and impress everyone else by buying so much expensive stuff just trying to show how much money they have.
When in reality behind the scenes they are much worse off than a tonne of people because they have so much on credit or such an expensive lifestyle that they
have to keep getting more and more, and if they were to lose a job then they have such little net worth set aside they are screwed.

Compare that to more "secret" millionaires that don't feel the need to buy all the latest designer items or expensive cars and instead use their money wisely
to make sure they have assets and not liabilities. Their net worths are so vast in comparison and it wouldn't matter if they suddenly lost their job etc as most of them are self employed or have businesses anyway but their net worth can easily cover years or decades of their lifestyles. 

The true meaning of being wealthy is not just how much money you earn or spend, it's how long you can survive if you lost your job tomorrow with the money/assets you have.
