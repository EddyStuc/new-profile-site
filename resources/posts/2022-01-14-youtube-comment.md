**Why can't I comment on youtube videos??**
***
The question I had been pulling my hair out for days trying to figure out. Every time I would go to click on the 
comment section to attempt a comment it would instantly re-direct me to the youtube homepage with no other message.

I had done multiple searches trying to find a reason or answer to this and it wasn't until I tried commenting on my phone that
it actually gave me an error message which I could finally Google. It turns out that my Google account didn't have my name set so 
as a default it was using my email as a name, which in turn didn't allow me to comment on any video. 

So simple yet so frustrating.
