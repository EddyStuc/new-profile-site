**Taking a leap**
***
So after 12 years of being a plumber/heating engineer it finally came the time this week for me to hand in my notice. 

Since starting to study software development last year I had been wanting to start looking for positions at the beginning of 2022 to make the
career change. So the time had come to begin looking and be able to get a job where I can further my learning at an even faster pace being able to do 
it daily in a real world environment.

I have now been given an amazing opportunity to join a great company in Plymouth where I will be able to make this dream come true. I will be starting in March and
I cannot wait to see where this takes me. It is a terrifying thing to be changing career completely but the excitement dwarfs that feeling and I am looking forward to
becoming a worthy addition to their team and being able to grow with them and make amazing contributions to their work over the coming years.

Onwards!
